# Meet My Friends

This is a simple Javascript app that does the following:
- Displays "Hello, World" centered horizontally on the page.
- Changes the color of "World" to white, and gives it a black background.
- Adds a greeting for each of my friends on the page, each on their own line and centered.
- Lists my friends: Ray, Oscar, Gwen, Bob, and Marie.
- Lists my friend's names in their favorite colors: red, orange, green, blue, and magenta, respectively.
- Adds a colored background to each of my friend's names that provides reasonable contrast with their favorite color.
- Makes the text bigger and adds a couple of CSS styles, such as rounded borders and padding between the names.
- I don't show any favoritism: my friend's names are dipslayed in a random order each time the page is loaded.

In addition:
- I gave each friend their own special greeting.
- The colors of my friend's name and background switch when you mouse over their name.
